          This project was developed by Rubens Anderson de Sousa Silva, supervised by Profa. Rossana Maria de Castro Andrade, in a Master's
          project linked to the Master's and Doctorate in Computer Science (MDCC) program at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), in
          conjunction with the Department of Computing (DC).
        </p>
        <p class="ph">
          The tool, entitled D-CreEA Card Games, aims to assist the development of educational analog games customizable, by computing
          teachers who have little or no game development experience.
        </p>
        <p class="ph">
          This is a work in constant evolution. Therefore, there may be failures or difficulties during use. To report any difficulty,
          suggestions or contact: dcreea@gmail.com
        </p>

        <h2>Development with D-CreEA Card Games</h2>
        <p class="ph">
          To develop a game using D-CreEA, you need to create an account with your email. In addition, it is important to have notions of
          diagram manipulation
        </p>
        <p class="ph">The development of a game follows the steps of prototyping a traditional analog game:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Modeling the Ideia</li>
          <li>Game Develop Document (GDD)</li>
          <li>Modeling the gameplay</li>
          <li>Description of the rules</li>
          <li>Gameloop</li>
          <li>Cards and Deck implementation</li>
          <li>Game Manual implementation</li>
          <li>Print</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="ph">
          The differential of D-CreEA Card Games is the standardization of this process. In addition to the step-by-step not being trivial
          to follow, the default description helps people who are not knowledgeable about analog game development, and who are interested in
          developing more quickly.
        </p>
        <p class="ph">Thus, the development screens follow the following pattern:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Game Details</li>
          <li>Diagram</li>
          <li>GamePlay</li>
          <li>Decks</li>
          <li>Cards</li>
          <li>Print</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="ph">
          On this page, we will explain in detail how to use each of the pages. In addition, there are videos explaining in practice the
          operation of D-CreEA Card Games.
        </p>
        <h3>Game Details</h3>

        <p class="ph">
          On the Game Details page reside the fields that would be found in the GDD. We chose an implementation complete enough to describe
          the idea of ​​the game and how it should work, from a macro perspective. Obviously, the idea must change during the project of the
          game, so all fields are editable.
        </p>
        <p class="ph">The fields that exist on this page are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name: the name of the game</li>
          <li>Authors: The authors of the game</li>
          <li>The gameplay, described in a simplified and macro way</li>
          <li>Game description, free form</li>
          <li>Game's target audience</li>
          <li>Game Knowledge Field</li>
          <li>Knowledge needed/important to play the game</li>
          <li>Recommended minimum and maximum number of players</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="ph">In addition, you need to save changes to persist in the database.</p>

        <h3>GamePlay</h3>

        <p class="ph">
          This screen is responsible for modeling the rules and their relationships. The system provides a standard game model for the user
          to develop without having to start from scratch, and still be able to better understand the working dynamics of the tool.
        </p>

        <p class="ph">
          The default game is based on the diagram shown below. The game has the following types of moves (also called mechanics): (I) Solve
          a Challenge; (II) Use a Bonus, and (III) Bargain.
        </p>

        <h3>States and Rules</h3>

        <p class="ph">
          Each <b>state</b> (rectangle) represents a moment in the game. Each state has its specific rules. Therefore, states encapsulate
          rules for each phase of the game, according to its purpose. The rules are always linked to states, and can change state
          (Transition) or remain in the same (Statement).
        </p>

        <p class="ph">Regarding the types of rules, there are two: <b>Statement</b> Rule and <b>Transition Rule</b>.</p>
        <p class="ph">
          <b>Statement Rule</b>: has an action or effect that explains how a game situation should occur, or can be applied to some player,
          thus changing their status. However, after applying the effects, the state remains the same, and it depends on the transition.
          choose the next steps. Finally, this rule has two modes: a general and a precise one.
        </p>
        <p class="ph">
          <b>Transition Rule</b>: This type has two modes: Conditional and Simple. On the Conditional Transition, unlike the Statement, this
          alters the state according to conditionals that depend on the game context. The rule has the form `IF condition THEN effect AND go
          to State X`. For each condition, the status that should be followed if the test is true is indicated. Each test has the option of
          general and simplified. As for the Simple Transition, only the following state is chosen, without conditions or effects.
        </p>

        <h3>GameLoop</h3>
        <p class="ph">
          The gameloop is the visual representation of the game's game play. It's a loop, because in each round, the same moves must be
          possible.
        </p>
        <p class="ph">
          A <b>game mechanic</b> is a set of states within the game loop that represents and implements a high-level type of play.
        </p>
        <p class="ph"></p>
        <p class="ph">
          <b>Example of mechanics</b>: to solve a challenge, the player (1) must choose a card from his hand, (2) match the card chosen with
          any challenge card available, (3) check if the card can solve the challenge (determined according to the defined rule), (4) If
          right, go to victory state; otherwise, go to the defeat state. Here, we can identify the fragments that make up the state of
          Solving a Challenge:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>pick a card from the hand</li>
          <li>Combine the card</li>
          <li>Verify if the card resolves the challenge</li>
          <li>[conditional] If hit, go to the victory state; otherwise, go to the defeat state.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="ph">
          Note that this state contains all the logic for solving the challenge, but not the scoring logic. This is recommended to better
          isolate the roles and responsibilities of each state. It helps, for example, to isolate the types of punctuation and effects that
          may result from the victory or defeat.
        </p>
        <p class="ph"></p>
        <p class="ph">
          Every game must have unique <b>Game Start</b> and a <b>Game Over</b> States, which represent, respectively, the beginning and the
          end of the game.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>States are represented by <b>rectangles</b>.</li>
          <li>
            Transition rules are represented by <b>arrows</b>, which indicate where and where to go after the built-in and conditional rules
            be applied.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some states have <b>conditional rules</b>, and this condition is represented by a <b>diamond</b> just below the state, with its
            conditions from him.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ph">
          Each type of play is represented by a loop between the Play or Next Player state and other states. Also, there are plays that can
          end the game, reaching the state of Game Over.
        </p>
        <p class="ph">
          You can create, edit and delete states according to your game and your needs. However, there are restrictions: it is only possible
          remove a state if there is no other state pointing to it. Also, you cannot change the Game Start or the Game. Over.
